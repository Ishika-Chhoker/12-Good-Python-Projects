# 12 Python Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of **12 Python projects** designed to practice and understand core programming concepts in Python. Each project is built from scratch with a focus on logic building, user interaction, and simplicity. These mini-projects are perfect for looking to strengthen Python skills through hands-on experience.

## Project List

1. **Madlibs**  
   A simple word game where the user fills in the blanks to create a fun, personalized story.

2. **Guess the Number (Computer Version)**  
   The computer tries to guess the number the user is thinking of using a binary search strategy.

3. **Guess the Number (User Version)**  
   The user guesses a number randomly chosen by the computer, with feedback after each guess.

4. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   A classic game where the user plays against the computer in a best-of-three format.

5. **Hangman**  
   A text-based version of the Hangman game, where the player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word.

6. **Tic-Tac-Toe (2 Player)**  
   A two-player game implemented in the console where players take turns marking spaces on a 3Ã—3 grid.

7. **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI**  
   A single-player version of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user plays against a basic computer AI.

8. **Binary Search Visualizer**  
   A script demonstrating the working of the binary search algorithm on a sorted list of numbers.

9. **Minesweeper (Text-Based)**  
   A terminal version of the classic Minesweeper game with adjustable difficulty levels.

10. **Sudoku Solver**  
   A backtracking algorithm implementation that solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty.

11. **Photo Manipulation in Python**  
   Uses Python libraries to perform basic photo editing operations like rotation, contrast enhancement, etc.

12. **Markov Chain Text Composer**  
   Generates random but grammatically correct sentences by learning patterns from input text using Markov Chains.
